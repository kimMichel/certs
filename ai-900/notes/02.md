# What Azure AI Vision is (in AI-900 terms)

A ready-made set of computer-vision capabilities you call via API. You don't train a model from scratch; You use Microsoft's pretrained models for common vision task.

## 1) Core workloads you must recognize

### - Image Classification

- Input an image -> Output: one or more labels (e.g., "cat", "indoor")
- Think: What is tin this image?

### - Object detection

- Input: an image -> Ouput: bounding boxes + labels for each object (e.g, find all cars with coordinates).
- Think: where are the things?

### - OCR (text extraction)

- Read printed/handwritten text from images or PDFs; extracts the text content (and sometimes layout).
- Think: Turn scanned docs/receipts into text.

### - Image analysis / features

- Descriptions, tags, properties, sometimes face detection (presence/positions - not identify).
- Think: Quick facts about the image.

## 2) When to pick Vision vs other services

| Needs | Service |
|:------|:--------|
| Need text from an image/PDF | Vision (OCR) |
| Need labels or boxes on object | Vision |
| Need to analyze text (sentiment, PII, entities, summarization) | Azure AI Language |
| Audio to text / text to speech / speech transalteion | Azure AI Speech |
| Chat, completions, free-form generation | Azure OpenAI |
| Train a custom model | Azure Machine Learning |

## 3) Responsible AI items (vision-flavored)

- Privacy & Security: protect images with RBAC, Private Links, Key Vault for keys.
- Fairness: beware dataset bias (e.g., poor performance on under-represented groups).
- Transparency: disclose automated processing when appropriate.
