# What Azure OpenAI is

A Generative AI Service in Azure that gives you LLMs (Large Language Models) like GPT for:

- Chat & Q&A

- Text generation (emails, summaries, code, instructions)

- Image generation (when enabled)

- Reasoning over contet (with retrieval / RAG in your app)

You don't train models from scratch. You deploy a model in your Azure subscription and call it via REST/SDK. Azure adds entreprise controls (securtiy, networking, governance).

## When to use Azure OpenAI (vs other services)

Use Azure OpenAI when you need free-form generation or chat:

- Draft emails, summaries, or explanations.

- Answer questions from documents (with retrieval / RAG).

- Generate code snippets or templates.

- Transform or classify text with flexible prompts.

Use other services when:

- OCR/text from image -> Vision (OCR) first.

- Analyse plain text (sentiment, PII, entities) -> Language often suffices.

## Core pieces (know these names)

- Deployment: you create a model deployment (e.g., "gtp-x") in your Azure OpenAI resources.

- Completions/Chat: send a prompt (or messages) -> get generated text.

- System / User / Assistant messages: structure chat behavior.

- Contet filters / Safety: built-in controls to reduce unsafe outputs.

- Rate limits & tokens: requests are limited output measured in tokens.
