# AI/ML Concepts + Responsible AI

## 1) AI/ML Concepts (what you must know)

- AI vs ML vs DL
  - AI: systems that perfom tasks needing "intelligence"
    - ML: models learn patterns from data (no hard-coded rules).
    - Deep Learning: ML with neural networks (great for images/speech).

- Learning types
  - Supervised learning (needs labels)
        - Goal: learn from examples with answers so it can predict answers for new data.
        - Two common tasks:
            - Classification (pick a class): cat vs dog, spam vs not spam.
            - Regression (predict a number): house price, delivery time.
    - Unsupervised learning (uses no labels)
      - Goal: find patterns or groups by itself.
        - Common tasks:
          - Clustering: group similar items (e.g., customer segments).
            - Dimensionality reduction: compress data while keeping meaning (e.g., PCA).
    - Reinforcement learning (learn by reward)
      - An agent tries actions, gets rewards/penalty, improves over time (games, robotics, recommendations).
        - Think: "Trial and error with a score."

## 2) Responsible AI (what they test conceptually)

Microsoft's principles: **fairness, reliability & safety, privacy & security, inclusiveness, transparency, accountability**.

- Problems to avoid: **bias** (unfair results), **hallucinations** (LLMs invent facts), **privacy leaks (PII)**, **prompt attacks**.
- Fixes: check data for fairness, keep a **human** reviewing important things, use content filters, protect data with RBAC/Private Link/ Key Vault, and log what happens.

## 3) "Scenario -> Service" (the exam's big trick)

When you read a question, ask: "What do they want to do?" Then choose the service:

| You need... | Use this Azure Service |
|:------------|:-----------------------|
| Read text from an image/PDF | Azure AI Vision (OCR) |
| Classify an image or detect objects | Azure AI Vision |
| Turn speech -> text, or text -> speech, or translate speech | Azure AI Speech |
| Understand text (sentiment, PII, entities), summarize | Azure AI Language |
| Chat / generate text or images | Azure OpenAI |
| Build a bot / orchestrate multiple AI steps | Azure AI Foundry / Bot Service |
| Train your own model (custom AI) | Azure Machine Learning |

Remember:

- Ready-make feature (OCR, sentiment, STT)? -> Vision/Language/Speech
- Free-form chat/generation? -> Azure OpenAI
- Must train your own model? -> Azure ML

## 4) Tiny examples

- Scan receipts and read handwriting -> **Vision (OCR)**
- Podcast -> text -> translate -> **Speech**
- Find names and amounts in text -> **Language(entities/PII)**
- Chatbot that writes emails with company docs -> **Azure OpenAI(+ retrieval)**
- Detect all cars with boxes in an image -> **Vision (object detection)**
- Build a churn predictor with my data -> **Azure ML**
