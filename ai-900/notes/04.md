# What Azure AI Speech is

A prebuilt audio AI Service. You send audio (or text) and get:

- STT: Speech-to-Text (transcription)

- TTS: Text-to-Speech (neural voices)

- Speech translation: speech <-> text across languages.

You don't train from scratch; you use Microsoft's pretrained models, with light customizations when needed.

## Core capabilities (know these names)

### Speech-to-Text (STT/Transcription)

- Convert audio -> text (real-time or batch).

- Options you may see: punctuation, timestamps, speacker diarization (split speakers), profanity filtering.

### Texto-to-Speech (TTS/neural voices)

- Convert text -> natural speech (many voices / locales).

- Useful for IVR, accessibility, spoken responses.

### Speech translation

- Audio in one language -> text (or speech) in another language.

### Customization (lightweight)

- Custom vocabulary/pronunciation (lexicons) for brand names, jargon.

- Accoustic tweaks (at a high level) when audio conditions are special.

AI-900 level  = recognize what to use (STT/TTS/Translation) and when to add custom words.

## When to pick Speech vs other services

| Needs | Service |
|:------|:--------|
| Audio -> text (meetings, voicemail, podcasts) | Speech (STT) |
| Text -> audio (IVR, read reports aloud) | Speech (TTS) |
| Cross-language audio (live translation) | Speech translation |
| Plain text analysis (sentiment, PII, entities) | Language |
| Custom training beyound prebuilt NLP | Azure ML |
