# What Azure AI Language is

A prebuilt text AI service. You send plain text and it returns analysis. You don't train from scratch; You use Microsoft's pretrained models.

## 1) Core capabilities you must recognize

### - Sentiment Analysis

- Tells if text is positive/negative/neutral (often with confidence).

### - Key phrase extraction

- Pulls the main ideas (e.g., "delivery delay", "refund")

### - Entity Recognition (NER)

- Finds names, products, locations, etc.

- Related: PII detection/redaction (emails, phones, SSNs).

### - Summarization

- Turns long text into short summarizes (extractive / abstrative options).

### - Language detection

- Identifies the language of the text.

### - Q&A / Conversational Language

- Build question - answer experiences from content / FAQs.
