# What Azure ML is (exam view)

A platform to train, tune, register, deploy and manage your own ML models.

## Core building blocks (know these names)

- Workspace: your ML "home" (assets, runs, models).

- Data assets: versioned references to your datasets.

- Compute: where training runs (CPU/GPU) clusters, compute instances.

- Auto ML: point it a data; it tries algorithms/params for you.

- Pipelines: chain steps (prep -> train evaluate -> register -> deploy).

- Model registry: versioned models with metada.

- Endpoints: online (real-time) or batch (offline) inference.
